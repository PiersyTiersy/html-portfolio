<h2>Top 5 Songs of UDOALG</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Oni Go to the Perpetual Mountain</h3>
<p><b>Love</b> the unique chord progression, and agressive, yet low Blow Tenor. The Piano is also doing a bunch of 9ths which sound great, and give the theme a rather 
    unique touch.</p>

<h3>The Path to Yomi Where None Turn Back</h3>
<p>The beautiful harmony running through the entirety of this song is majestic, powerful, dark, and filled with beauty. not to mention the astounding piano work. 
    This song is 9th heaven. Also love the Dulcimer</p>

<h3>The Deviants' Unobstructed Light ~ Kingdom of Nothingness</h3>
<p>The Mongolian Chants truly make this theme one of a kind. The emotional weight running through the entirety of this song is rather unique, compared to Pure Furies or 
    Little Princess, thanks to its rather unusual "hidden", or "drowned by emotion" approach to power</p>

<h3>A Beast's Intelligence</h3>
<p>Powerful and emotional. The Main chorus feels so warm and familiar thanks to the main motif + VI - VII - i. The jazzy part with the violin and no piano, is refreshing and 
    really unique.</p>

<h3>Magical Beast Scramble</h3>
<p>Incredible Piano, unique use of st. strings, peculiar rythms (9/8,7/8), and that <b>AMAZING</b> ending make this theme stand out a lot. </p>
